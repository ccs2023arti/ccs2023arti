<h3 id="weakcamid--brief"><strong>WeakCamID</strong>  Brief</h3>
<p>Wireless security cameras may deter intruders. Accompanying the hardware, consumers may pay recurring monthly fees for recording videos to the cloud, or use the free tier offering motion alerts and sometimes live streams via the camera app. Many users may purchase the hardware without buying the subscription to save money, which inherently reduces their efficacy. We discover that the wireless traffic generated by a camera responding to stimulating motion may disclose whether or not video is being streamed. A malicious user such as a burglar may use such knowledge to target homes with a “weak camera” that does not upload video or turn on live view mode. In such cases, criminal activities would not be recorded though they are performed within the monitoring area of the camera. Accordingly, we describe a novel technique called WeakCamID that creates motion stimuli and sniffs resultant wireless traffic to infer the camera state. We perform a survey involving a total of 220 users, finding that all users think cameras have a consistent security guarantee regardless of the subscription status. Our discovery breaks such “common sense”. We implement <strong>WeakCamID</strong> in a mobile app and experiment with 11 popular wireless cameras to show that <strong>WeakCamID</strong> can identify weak cameras with a mean accuracy of around 95% and within less than 19 seconds.</p>

<pre class=" language-python"><code class="prism  language-python">python3 <span class="token punctuation">[</span>section name<span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>py 
</code></pre>
<p>If you notice that we are using mathlab to show our final result and you want to  find <code>Matlab</code>  codes we shown on our paper with same result, read <code>Code</code> part which should be on the bottom of each section page.</p>
<pre><code>1. Download the Matlab file with associte data
   (*.zip format) shown on the page.
2. Open *.m file after unzip the file.
3. Run the *.m file on Matlab.
</code></pre>
